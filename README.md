# Diabetes Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques. It leverages health-related data such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and other factors to build and evaluate classification models.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

## Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from publicly available diabetes datasets (e.g., the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deployment as a web application
- Integration with healthcare data pipelines
